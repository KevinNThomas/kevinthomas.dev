### Overview

Welcome to my new website!

This website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. The theme of this website is based off <a href="https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout" target="_blank">Hydeout</a> by Andrew Fong.

The repository for this website can be found on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/KevinNThomas/kevinthomas.dev" target="_blank">Gitlab</a>.

### Why Jekyll?

I wanted to build my website with the tools that satisfied these requirements:
* Not too much bloat
* Mobile friendly
* Quick initial setup
* Lots of free and open source themes
* Ability to create a modern, but simple website
* Easy to update website with new pages and sections

Jekyll and the Hydeout theme met all of these requirements, and they've been great to work with.
