<p>Welcome to my new website!</p>

<p>This website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. The theme of this website is based off <a href="https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout">Hydeout</a> by Andrew Fong.</p>

<p>The repository for this website can be found on GitLab here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/KevinNThomas/kevinthomas.dev">https://gitlab.com/KevinNThomas/kevinthomas.dev</a></p>

<h3 id="why-jekyll">Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p>I wanted to build my website with the tools that satisfied these requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not too much bloat</li>
  <li>Quick initial setup</li>
  <li>Lots of free and open source themes</li>
  <li>Ability to create a modern, but simple website</li>
  <li>Easy to update website with new pages and sections</li>
</ul>

<p>Jekyll and the Hydeout theme met all of these requirements, and theyâ€™ve been great to work with.</p>
